I'm sure you've heard the metaphors, a popular one being to think of a website as a house. In this scenario, HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the framework and what's used to build the house (website). HTML tells your browser how to structure the site you're visiting. 

And in keeping within the building theme, elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. Elements are represented by tags, and most have both an opening and closing tag which look like this <> </>, the content is placed between the opening and closing tags. 

It looks pretty simple to begin with:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html> 
   
	 <head>
	    <title></title>
	 </head>
	 <body></body>
	 
</html>
```

This all takes a little getting used to but once you have the basics down, it's a lot easier to build a more complex structure. Plus, there are a ton of HTML cheat sheets you can refer to. Most break down what each element does and how it's tag should look. And if you're not familiar with something, use your resources- the internet being the most obvious and wide-reaching! We're here to learn, right?
