Why am l learning software development? My answer will probably sound pretty generic; it was time for a change. I'm sure many people have found themselves in a similar situation with their current career/life path. I was feeling painfully stagnant. I wasn't being creative anymore and I definitely wasn't learning anything new. Not good.

Most of my career has been spent as a talent manager and in many respects itâ€™s allowed me to be both creative and analytical but it's incredibly limiting. I reached the point of having got all that I could out of it. Coding will also allow me to be both creative and analytical and it's anything but limiting. 

I've been dealing with a lot of obstacles in my redefinition of success. But instead of just giving up or continuing down the same, tired path I've been on, I decided to make that change. I was accepted to Flatiron School. So here I am, now able to constantly be learning something new, and learning how to learn. My hope is, at end of this program, the outcome is finding a new career path that both inspires and is inspiring. I would like to have an impact on people with my work and I think learning to be a developer will enable me to do that.

Happy Coding!
